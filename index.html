      <h2>Colour Runner</h2>
      <p>A mobile game using the camera. A thick coloured stoke is displayed around the live camera view. The player is required to match the colour within the camera view within a short period of time.</p>
      <p>The colour has to be within a certain threshold of the challenge to pass the level. As you progress the time gets shorter and the accuracy required increases. Points are awarded for both a timely match as well as how accurately the colour was matched.</p>

      <h2>GeoBase</h2>
      <p>A geo-location based game. Players form into two teams, attack &amp; defence. A point is placed on a map, the goal is for the attack team to get 50% or more of their players within a few hundred yards of the point.</p>
      <p>Players on the attack team can see a radar of defence players nearby, but if they come too close to a member of the defence team they will be alerted via a vibration on their phone. Furthermore if any attack plays get close to the target area all players in the game are notified.</p>
      <p>When a player on the attack team is caught they switch sides. Points are awarded in two ways - For the attack team it is how quickly you arrived at the target location - For the defence team is how many members you caught.</p>

      <h2>Rube Codeburg</h2>
      <p>A hosted platform that allows you to add your Rube Goldberg machines. A user uploads their machine and specifies a HTTP endpoint for that machine.</p>
      <p>A webhook is fired to that endpoint, they then have a minimum of 3 seconds and a maximum of 30 seconds to do whatever they like before responding back with a POST request.</p>
      <p>For instance they might have an elaborate machine where the webhook turns on a fan, that blows a sail boat, that hits a ball, that presses a button resulting in the response.</p>
      <p>If they can achieve 3 consecutive successful executions of their machine they may take part in the annual Rube Codeburg day (4th July) where the output of one machine is the input to the next creating the worlds largest Rube Goldburg machine.</p>
